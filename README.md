# Minecraft Server Updater

This Project was created in 2 days to enable me to automatically update my Linux Server.
It's specially made in mind with curseforge which doesn't support private mod packs.
With that you are able to handle updates from your custom mod packs. Only mods
which are find in the **server side** will be updated.
Theoretically this script should work with Linux Client and Windows Server too.
But practical it was only tested with Windows Client and Linux Server.

# Configuration
You need to create a config.ini from the example one, you can test the connection than with the `TestConnection.py` Script.
After that you need to start the `Main.py`.
When i find time to package it, then maybe it's just a executable to be run.

# Interest in use/extensions
if there is any interest, then please create a issue and i will beautify this project.
